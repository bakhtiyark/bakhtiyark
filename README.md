### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Salutations there! My name is Bakhtiyar and i am an aspiring Web Developer, writing code in VanillaJS, React, intermidiate NodeJS, MongoDB and CSS/SASS preprocessor and in the process of learning their idiosyncrasies and more complex subjects. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: migrating existing vanilla JS projects to React.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Design Patterns
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm an honorable blood donor.
